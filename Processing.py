# save file in variable
# long method (check for lines of code (no more than 15) from every "def", use regex)
# long parameter list (check line of def, use regex to see parameters within commas after the ( and before the ))
# duplicated code (use Jaccard Similarity for each method, compare two at a time)
# refactor dup (whichever method is called more, replace lesser used ones with the more used ones, send to FileLogic)
